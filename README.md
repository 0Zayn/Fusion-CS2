(Note: I am not liable for any issues this cheat may create, I have not currently received any VAC bans)

Ask me before using any of this code for a product that is being released to the public

This should be maintained every week, if I'm not lazy.
Great source for beginners to learn

**Recommend any features/changes, and they most likely will be added.**

To-Do:
- Add keybind changing for aimbot
- Add customization of colors
- Add more ESP styles (Including skeleton esp)
- Add chams
